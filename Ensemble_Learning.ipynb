        "#1) Can we use Bagging for regression problems?\n",
        "- Answer: Yes. Bagging can be used for regression by training multiple regression models on different bootstrap samples and averaging their predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "#2) What is the difference between multiple model training and single model training?\n",
        "- Answer: Single model training uses one model on the entire dataset, while multiple model training (ensemble) trains several models and combines their outputs for better performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "#3) Explain the concept of feature randomness in Random Forest\n",
        "- Answer: In Random Forest, a random subset of features is selected at each split, which reduces correlation between trees and improves generalization.\n",
        "\n",
        "#4) What is OOB (Out-of-Bag) Score?\n",
        "- Answer: OOB score is an internal validation method in Bagging/Random Forest where samples not used in training a tree are used to test it.\n",
        "\n",
        "#5) How can you measure the importance of features in a Random Forest model?\n",
        "- Answer: Feature importance is measured using mean decrease in impurity (Gini importance) or permutation importance.\n",
        "\n",
        "#6) Explain the working principle of a Bagging Classifier\n",
        "- Answer: A Bagging Classifier trains multiple classifiers on different bootstrap samples and predicts the final class using majority voting.\n",
        "\n",
        "#7) How do you evaluate a Bagging Classifier’s performance?\n",
        "- Answer: Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, and OOB score.\n",
        "\n",
        "#8) How does a Bagging Regressor work?\n",
        "- Answer: It trains multiple regression models on bootstrap samples and averages their predictions to produce the final output.\n",
        "\n",
        "#9) What is the main advantage of ensemble techniques?\n",
        "- Answer: They improve accuracy, stability, and generalization by combining multiple models.\n",
        "\n",
        "#10) What is the main challenge of ensemble methods?\n",
        "- Answer: Increased computational cost and reduced interpretability.\n",
        "\n",
        "#11) Explain the key idea behind ensemble techniques\n",
        "- Answer: Combining multiple weak or diverse models to create a stronger and more reliable model.\n",
        "\n",
        "#12) What is a Random Forest Classifier?\n",
        "- Answer: It is an ensemble of decision trees built using bagging and feature randomness for classification tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "#13) What are the main types of ensemble techniques?\n",
        "- Answer: Bagging, Boosting, and Stacking.\n",
        "\n",
        "#14) What is ensemble learning in machine learning?\n",
        "- Answer: Ensemble learning is the technique of combining predictions from multiple models to improve overall performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "#15) When should we avoid using ensemble methods?\n",
        "- Answer: When the dataset is very small, interpretability is critical, or computational resources are limited.\n",
        "\n",
        "#16) How does Bagging help in reducing overfitting?\n",
        "- Answer: By training models on different subsets of data and averaging predictions, variance is reduced.\n",
        "\n",
        "#17) Why is Random Forest better than a single Decision Tree?\n",
        "- Answer: Random Forest reduces overfitting, improves accuracy, and is more robust to noise.\n",
        "\n",
        "#18) What is the role of bootstrap sampling in Bagging?\n",
        "- Answer: It creates diverse training datasets by sampling with replacement, enabling model diversity.\n",
        "\n",
        "#19) What are some real-world applications of ensemble techniques?\n",
        "- Answer: Fraud detection, medical diagnosis, stock prediction, image recognition, and recommendation systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "#20) What is the difference between Bagging and Boosting?\n",
        "- Answer: Bagging trains models independently to reduce variance, while Boosting trains models sequentially to reduce bias."
